# lectures

Subdirectory for lecture notebooks and slides and other materials
used for class instruction.  Currently the lectures are
subdivided mainly by content source, though also by topic.

## homl

Lecture notebooks to accompany class textbook:

- Aurelian Geron (2019). [Hands-On Machine Learning with SciKit-Learn and TensorFlow: Concepts, tools, and techniques to build intelligent systems](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/). 2nd Edition, O'Reilly Media.

There is a lot of overlap of content with the official
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml)
notebooks for the textbook as I follow along with the examples.
But these slides accompany videos I will make going over the
textbook content, and I will add additional examples and
thoughts and organized some materials differently and skip others
than presented in our text.

## ng

Lecture notebooks for Andrew Ng's excellent set of course videos
on Machine Learning.  Here is a playlist of all of the videos
from the course:

[Andrew Ng online Machine Learning Course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ9qNFMHZ-A4rycgrgOYma6zxF4BZGGPW)

I will be assigning most of these videos as additional materials to
watch for the course, and some to many of them will be required to
watch and review.

## python-stack

Videos of my own from various sources covering the Scientific
Python Stack.  We will spend the first week or 2 learning the
basics of Python and the scientific Python stack.  Our goal is not
to become experts in Python, but to become familiar enough with the
language to use the machine learning libraries and tools we
introduce in the class.  We don't expect you to be an expert in
the Python language after these quick tutorials and introductions, but
you will pick up a lot of additional skills later on just from following
the Python examples in the rest of the course.

Resources used for these notebooks and videos include:

**Textbooks and Textual Tutorials**

- [Think Python: How to think like a computer scientist](http://www.greenteapress.com/think-python-2e/) 2nd Edition.  Free online textbook, very good resource for not only Python but learning to program in general.
- [Software Carpentry](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/) section on learning Python is also very good, and also includes videos.

**Video Tutorials**
- [Learn Python - Full course for beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw)
- [Google Developers Python Class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/?hl=ru&csw=1) short course with videos, might be helpful for those looking for video tutorials of Python.
